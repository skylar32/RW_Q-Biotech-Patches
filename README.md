The aim of this mod is to fill some of the gaps left in the Biotech expansion.

# Core functionality changes

* Children born into a tribal colony now have the natural meditation focus.
* The xenotype of the "Wanderer joins" ritual reward is selected randomly from
  the xenotypes of the ritual attendees.
* Genemodding now counts as a body modification for the purposes of the body
  modder trait and transhumanist ideologies. However, the presence of a xenogerm
  only counts as one modification, no matter how many genes are inside it.
  Subsequent implantations are not currently counted as "new" modifications.

# New precepts

## Xenodiversity

Xenodiversity is a measure of the number of different xenotypes in your colony.
Pawns following bigoted ideologies are peeved by the presence of xenotypes other
than their own within the colony, and receive a mood bonus when the colony's
xenotypes are uniform. Pawns following progressive ideologies receive modest
mood bonuses as the colony grows more diverse.

## Growth vats

In vanilla, colonists disapprove of growth vats by default. They get a bit sad
when their children are in them. The growth vats precept supplies two
alternative options aside from the default of disapproval:

* Colonists who abhor growth vats will be devastated if their child is put in
  one, and will become uncomfortable if growth vats are constructed in the colony.
* Colonists who prefer growth vats will get worried if their child is not in a
  growth vat, and once their expectations are moderate, they will become
  uncomfortable if there are no growth vats constructed in the colony.

## Birth control

This is a higher impact precept. It is not set by default, but you can select
birth control preferred or birth control prohibited.

Pawns who prefer birth control will get a bit anxious if they have not been
sterilized. Once they are, they receive a modest mood bonus.

Pawns who prohibit birth control will refuse to perform birth control
procedures. If one is forced on them, they will experience a powerful mood
debuff until the procedure is reversed. Terminating the pregnancy of such a pawn
will also result in a strong negative mood effect. These pawns harbor negative
opinions towards pawns who have terminated their pregnancies.
